Step 1: Remember a small value (-1)
Step 2: Look at the first in the list
Step 3: Look at that value, if it is bigger than the value that we remembered we can replace the value with the new one (If 8 bigger than -1, we replace -1 with 8)
Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all the numbers in the list
Step 5: Return, or say the remembered value (which will be the largest)

Step 1: Start a stopwatch
Step 2: Check the stopwatch
Step 3: If the time is greater than 90 minutes we stop, if it is not greater than 90 minutes you go back to step 2
